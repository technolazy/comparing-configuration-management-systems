# [Comparing Configuration Management Systems][published url]
## Instructor: [Markus Mühlberger][instructor url]

Configuration management and automation are strategies that every systems administrator should know when managing more than a handful of servers. It is also very handy for developers who have to manage infrastructure, but prefer to write code to specify an environment, rather than typing configration commands by hand.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructur Markus Mühlberger is going to compare two of the most popular configuration management systems, Puppet and Chef. You'll see how to use both Puppet and Chef to create reproducable web application servers. By completing this task using both technologies, you'll see the strengths and weaknesses of each one.

## Source Files Description

The source files contain ready-to-use `Vagrantfile`s, that are tailored to work with each corresponding lesson. The source repository also contains a separate branch for Puppet, that contains all the modules and configuration we are going to create throughout the course. For Chef, the source files contain before and after folders, that reflect the state of the files at the start and end of the lessons.
